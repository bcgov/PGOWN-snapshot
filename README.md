Coding pipeline for the Provincial Groundwater Observation Well Network (PGOWN) snapshot (bi-annual)
Maintained by the LSDMR team in the EMA branch of the EPD division in the Ministry of Env and Parks

An R coding pipeline for retrieving & summarizing data from [AQUARIUS](https://bcenv-enmods.aqsamples.ca/) for the groundwater well network.

### Code structure

The coding flow has three streams of data input/output. 

data: contains reference data needed to run the scripts (data_jb, data_Rc, data_old) that need to be updated for each snapshot, and a folder for storing new data (data_new) generated on running this script.

generated: contains a copy of the figures and tables generated on running this script as well as their underlying data.

rcode: contains the R Markdown file that needs to be run to generate the output report "PGOWN-Snapshot.html". Also contains the script for API calls to the AQUARIUS database as well as an .Renviron that needs to be updated for each snapshot.

**Note:** The `pgown-snapshot` coding pipeline uses data from the AQUARIUS Time-Series API Client. However, data on that server is password protected. If you do not have verified and functional credentials, you will not be able to use this coding pipeline. If you have credentials, update them in the .Renviron file in the folder rcode. Currently they are set to test values and will not work. If you have credentials but encounter errors in running this code, please file an
[issue](https://github.com/bcgov/PGOWN-snapshot/issues/).

### Steps to run the code

1.

### Installation

To install the latest version from GitHub, use the
[remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes) package:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("bcgov/bcdata")
library(bcdata)
```

### Methods for `bcdc_promise`

The `bcdc_query_geodata()` returns an object of the class
`bcdc_promise`. We have written an ever growing list methods for this
class. You can use these methods directly on a object returned by
`bcdc_query_geodata()`. Here are all the methods for the `bcdc_promise`
class:

- `as_tibble`
- `collect`
- `filter`
- `head`
- `mutate`
- `names`
- `print`
- `select`
- `show_query`
- `tail`

### BCDC Authentication

If you are an authorized editor of the B.C. Data Catalogue you may want
to access records that are not publicly available (e.g., in DRAFT,
waiting to be published). This can be done by authenticating with the
catalogue with an API key.

***Important Note:*** *Your API key is like a password and you must take
care to keep it private. Do not share it, and be careful to not include
it in any scripts or accidentally commit it to GitHub.*

You can log in to the catalogue to obtain your API key, then store it as
an environment variable in your [`.Renviron`
file](https://rstats.wtf/r-startup.html#renviron). The environment
variable must be called `BCDC_KEY`, set like this:

    BCDC_KEY=your-api-key

This way, the relevant bcdata functions will read that key and use it to
authorize your calls to the catalogue, allowing you to access additional
records that you are authorized to see if you were logged into the
catalogue web interface. Functions that benefit from this are:

- `bcdc_search()`
- `bcdc_list()`
- `bcdc_get_record()`
- `bcdc_get_data()`
